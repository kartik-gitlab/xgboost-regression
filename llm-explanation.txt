
Here’s a breakdown of everything based on your code files and the previewed outputs:

---

## ?? **Code Overview and Explanation**

### `preprocessing.py`

This script cleans and transforms raw input data before feeding it to a model. Here's what each part does:

* **NaN Handling:** Replaces `inf/-inf` with `NaN`, flags missing targets (`NewPayUp_missing`).
* **Negative Flags:** Adds binary flags for negative numeric values (excluding specific columns).
* **Type Conversion:** Converts `object` types to numeric where possible.
* **Encoding:** Categorical columns (non-numeric) are label encoded.
* **Imputation:** Uses median imputation for missing numeric data.
* **Scaling:** Optionally scales numeric values with `StandardScaler`.

---

### `train.py`

This script trains two models:

* **Classifier:** Predicts whether `NewPayUp` is missing.
* **Regressor:** Predicts the value of `NewPayUp` (only for rows where it's present).

**Steps:**

* Loads and preprocesses data.
* Trains an `XGBClassifier` for missingness detection.
* Trains an `XGBRegressor` to estimate `NewPayUp` values.
* Saves trained models and preprocessing artifacts (scaler, imputer, features list).

---

### `predict.py`

This script applies the models and performs:

1. **Classification**: Uses the classifier to detect if `NewPayUp` is missing.
2. **Regression**: Predicts `NewPayUp` where it's present.
3. **Residual Calculation**: `residual = NewPayUp - predicted_NewPayUp`.
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Uses `IsolationForest` to flag anomalies based on feature distribution.
5. **Metrics Calculation**: Produces a dictionary of metrics covering classification, regression, anomaly detection, and performance.

---

## ?? **Prediction Output Columns Explanation**

From the first 10 rows:

* **`NewPayUp` / `predicted_NewPayUp`**: Ground truth vs predicted value.
* **`residual`**: Difference between actual and predicted.
* **`is_missing_predicted`**: Whether model predicted value as missing.
* **`is_anomaly`**: Whether row is flagged as an anomaly.
* **`anomaly_residuals`**: Anomaly score.
* **`anomaly_threshold`**: Threshold beyond which a row is considered anomalous.
* **`*_is_negative` flags**: Binary flags showing if original values were negative (used as features for model training).

* Suggestions for improving model robustness or generalization









Here are the explanations for the 6 rows flagged as anomalies by the `IsolationForest` model:

---

### ? General Context:

The anomaly score reflects how "different" a row is from the rest of the data. Rows above the **99th percentile threshold (0.6037)** were flagged. These rows often show extreme values or rare combinations across input features.

---

### ?? Anomalous Rows Breakdown:

#### **Row 31**

* **Coupon: 3.5% (low)**
* **OrigYear: 2005**
* **ActualSpread: 0**
* **NewPayUp: 5.6338**
* **Residual: 0.0086** (small)
* **Why Anomalous?** Likely due to the combination of older origination year, a 0 spread, and modest NewPayUp value — which may be rare in the training data.

---

#### **Row 200**

* **ActualSpread: 5.8976** (unusually high)
* **Coupon: 1.5% (very low)**
* **OrigYear: 2021**
* **Residual: -0.0038**
* **Why Anomalous?** That spread is **much higher than typical**, suggesting this loan may have unusual pricing behavior despite a recent origination.

---

#### **Row 304**

* **NewPayUp: 0** (missing or zero)
* **ActualSpread: 6.0116** (extremely high again)
* **Coupon: 3.5%**
* **Residual: \~0.0006** (negligible)
* **Why Anomalous?** The zero `NewPayUp` alongside high spread makes this an outlier.

---

#### **Row 366**

* **ActualSpread: 9.2325** (extreme)
* **Coupon: 7%**
* **NewPayUp: 0** and `predicted_NewPayUp` also negative (likely clipped)
* **Residual: 0.0087**
* **Why Anomalous?** That spread is exceptionally rare — likely the **highest in the dataset**.

---

#### **Row 374**

* **ActualSpread: 7.3727**
* **NewPayUp: 0**
* **Residual: 0.0076**
* **Why Anomalous?** Another example of unusually high spread with no NewPayUp. This mismatch may be statistically rare.

---

#### **Row 444**

* **Missing ActualSpread** (NaN)
* **NewPayUp: 0.4352**, Prediction: 0.4494
* **Residual: -0.0142**
* **Why Anomalous?** The missing spread could make this row incomplete in feature space — anomaly model flags missing or sparse inputs as outliers.

---

### ? Summary of Common Anomaly Causes:

* Extremely **high ActualSpread** values.
* **Zero or missing NewPayUp** values not matching model expectations.
* **Missing key features** (like `ActualSpread` in row 444).
* Rare **combinations of origination year, coupon, and spread**.

Would you like anomaly scores visualized or thresholds adjusted (e.g., 95th percentile) to explore borderline cases?






Absolutely — here’s a detailed explanation of **each metric calculated** in the `predict.py` program, how it's computed **in code**, and how it applies to **your actual data**.

---

## ?? **Classification Metrics**

(from predicting if `NewPayUp` is missing)

### 1. **Accuracy**

```python
accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
```

* **Definition**: Fraction of correct predictions.
* **Your Data**:
  `y_true = [1 if NewPayUp is null else 0]`
  `y_pred = predicted by classifier`
* **Result**: `1.0` (perfect classification)

---

### 2. **Balanced Accuracy**

```python
balanced_accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
```

* **Definition**: Mean of recall for each class.
  Useful when classes are imbalanced.
* **Your Data**: Equal weight to detecting both missing (1) and non-missing (0).
* **Result**: `1.0` (both classes perfectly predicted)

---

### 3. **Precision (for class=1 i.e. Missing)**

```python
precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
```

* **Definition**:
  `TP / (TP + FP)`
  Of all predicted missing, how many were correct?
* **Your Data**:
  `TP=127`, `FP=0` ? `127 / (127 + 0) = 1.0`

---

### 4. **Recall (for class=1)**

```python
recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
```

* **Definition**:
  `TP / (TP + FN)`
  Of all true missing, how many were found?
* **Your Data**:
  `TP=127`, `FN=0` ? `127 / (127 + 0) = 1.0`

---

### 5. **F1 Score**

```python
f1_score(y_true, y_pred)
```

* **Definition**:
  Harmonic mean of precision and recall:
  `2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)`
* **Your Data**: Both = 1 ? `F1 = 1.0`

---

### 6. **Confusion Matrix Components**

```python
tn, fp, fn, tp = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred).ravel()
```

* **TN (True Negative)** = 425
* **TP (True Positive)** = 127
* **FP, FN = 0**
  This forms:

```
            Pred 0   Pred 1
True 0       425        0
True 1         0      127
```

---

## ?? **Regression Metrics**

(from predicting actual `NewPayUp` values)

Applies **only to rows where `NewPayUp` is present and predicted** — i.e., 425 rows.

### 7. **R² Score**

```python
r2_score(y_reg_true, y_reg_pred)
```

* **Definition**: Proportion of variance explained by the model.
* **Formula**:
  `1 - (Sum of squared errors / Total variance)`
* **Result**: `0.9998` ? Very close fit to true values

---

### 8. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

```python
mean_absolute_error(y_reg_true, y_reg_pred)
```

* **Definition**: Average absolute error between predicted and actual.
* **Result**: `0.0167` (very low error)

---

### 9. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

```python
np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_reg_true, y_reg_pred))
```

* **Definition**: Square root of average squared error.
* **Result**: `0.0262` — slightly penalizes larger errors

---

### 10. **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**

```python
mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_reg_true, y_reg_pred)
```

* **Definition**: Mean of absolute error as percentage of actual.
* **Problem in Your Data**: Exploded to `3e12` due to **near-zero true values**, causing division by tiny numbers (e.g., 0.0001).

---

### 11. **Residual Mean & Std Dev**

```python
df.loc[mask, "residual"].mean()
df.loc[mask, "residual"].std()
```

* **Residual**: `NewPayUp - predicted_NewPayUp`
* **Mean**: Should be \~0 for unbiased model (yours: `0.00005`)
* **Std Dev**: Variation in errors (yours: `0.0262`)

---

## ? **Anomaly Detection Metrics**

(from `IsolationForest` applied to all rows)

### 12. **Anomaly Detection Threshold**

```python
threshold_99 = np.percentile(anomaly_scores, 99)
```

* **Meaning**: Top 1% most unusual rows
* **Your Value**: `0.6037`

---

### 13. **Total Anomalies Detected**

np.mean(anomaly_scores), np.std(anomaly_scores), np.max(anomaly_scores)
```

* **Average Score**: `0.4498`
* **Std Dev**: `0.0492`
* **Max Score**: `0.6271`

---

## ?? **Performance**

### 16. **Total Runtime**

```python
round(time.time() - t_start, 2)
```

* **Measured in seconds**
* **Your Value**: `0.39s`

Let me know if you’d like:

* Example metric values calculated from a specific row
* Visualization of residuals or anomaly scores
* How to fix the exploding MAPE issue






Here’s a concrete example of how metrics are calculated for one row:

* **True `NewPayUp`** = `6.3739`
* **Predicted `NewPayUp`** = `6.3772`
* **Residual** = `True - Predicted` = `-0.0033`

From these:

* **MAE (Absolute Error)** = `|6.3739 - 6.3772| = 0.0033`
* **RMSE (via Squared Error)** = `v0.000011 ˜ 0.0033`
* **MAPE** = `(0.0033 / 6.3739) ˜ 0.000518` = \~0.052%

This shows how even small residuals translate into low error metrics — consistent with your overall model's strong performance. Let me know if you'd like this repeated for an anomalous row or one with high residual.







Here's a row with a **high residual**, showing significantly larger prediction error:

* **True `NewPayUp`** = `3.3479`
* **Predicted `NewPayUp`** = `3.5416`
* **Residual** = `-0.1937` (an underprediction)

### Calculated Metrics:

* **MAE**: `0.1937` — this is a much larger error than the previous example.
* **RMSE (via squared error)**: `v0.03752 ˜ 0.1937`
* **MAPE**: `0.1937 / 3.3479 ˜ 5.79%`

This row stands out because:

* The residual is roughly **10x larger** than the average error in your dataset.
* It's not classified as an anomaly, meaning the model sees it as “normal” — yet its prediction is off.

Let me know if you'd like to dig into why the model might struggle with this particular case (e.g., feature distribution, influence, etc.).











Here's a detailed analysis of why the model may have struggled with this particular row (with residual = `-0.1937`):

| `Dealer1SourceSpread`        | 4.9755                      | Fairly high                                                 |
| `Dealer2AnalyticsSpread`     | 3.3479                      | Matches actual `NewPayUp`, suggesting it's from this source |
| `EpsilonBenchSpread`         | 2.5861                      | Lower than other spreads                                    |
| `AllDealerAverage`           | 3.6365                      | Higher than actual `NewPayUp`                               |
| `Dealer1Dealer2Average`      | 4.1617                      | Even higher                                                 |

| Negative flags               | All `0`                     | No anomalies in value signs                                 |

---

## ?? **Why the Model Might Struggle**

1. **Conflicting Dealer Spreads**:

   * `Dealer2AnalyticsSpread` exactly matches the true `NewPayUp`.
   * But **all other spreads** are significantly higher (dealer averages \~4.16).
   * The model likely weighted the average and dispersion more heavily than the exact dealer match.

2. **High Dispersion**:

   * `AllDealerAverageDispersion = 1.6276` — this suggests dealers disagree a lot.
   * High variance like this may confuse the model into trusting the higher averages over any one dealer.

3. **Low Coupon with High Spread**:

   * `Coupon = 1.5%` is very low — possibly underrepresented in training.
   * The spread values being so high for such a coupon may look suspicious to the model (unusual combo).

4. **ActualSpread = 0.0**:

   * No reported market spread could down-weight this row's credibility.
   * The model may interpret this as a lack of market interest.

---

## ? Suggestions

To improve predictions for edge cases like this:

* Include **feature importance diagnostics** — did the model ignore `Dealer2AnalyticsSpread`?
* Consider adding a **"confidence" score** for dealer alignment.
* Use **clustering pre-processing** to flag rows with contradictory dealer inputs.

Would you like to:

* Compare this with a well-predicted row?
* Visualize feature importances from the model?















Here’s a side-by-side comparison of the **high-residual row** vs. a **well-predicted row**:

## ?? **Key Differences**

| Feature                  | High Residual | Well Predicted        | Insight                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OrigYear`               | 2020          | 2009                  | Older loans may follow more stable pricing trends                                  |
| `ActualSpread`           | 0.0           | 1.2982                | Lack of market spread may confuse the model                                        |
| `Dealer1SourceSpread`    | 4.9755        | 0.0                   | High vs. zero — big spread discrepancy                                             |
| `Dealer2AnalyticsSpread` | 3.3479        | -1.9961               | Positive vs. negative — different pricing signals                                  |
| `AllDealerAverage`       | 3.6365        | NaN                   | Missing average in well-predicted row                                              |
| `Dealer1Dealer2Average`  | 4.1617        | NaN                   | Again, missing in well-predicted                                                   |
| `Dispersion`             | High (1.6+)   | High but fewer values | Conflicting dealer signals in both, but model likely ignores missing fields better |

---

## ? Interpretation

* The well-predicted row has **fewer features populated**, reducing noise.
* The high-residual row has **too many conflicting signals**, especially:

  * Spread from Dealer 2 matches the ground truth.
  * Others (averages, Dealer 1) are much higher — model may weigh them more.
* **Conclusion**: Too much conflicting input can lead to prediction deviation, especially when `ActualSpread` is zero and model relies on averages.

Would you like suggestions on **feature weighting or exclusion strategies** to improve prediction quality in such edge cases?
